# Dice Roller App - Create Different Versions of Your App

This project builds upon a [codelab by Google](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-variants), where I modified the Dice Roller application to create two distinct versions: "demo" and "full".

The Dice Roller app features an image of a die and a ROLL button beneath it. When the user clicks ROLL, the die rolls, and the image updates based on the result.

In this project, I added new project files and code to achieve the following:

- Develop "demo" and "full" product flavors of the app.
- Enhance the "full" version by adding a box to the layout.
- Program the box in the "full" version to display the roll result when the user clicks ROLL.
- Customize the app titles for both the "demo" and "full" versions.

Here's a preview of what the demo and full versions of the app look like:

| Demo | Full |
|------|------|
| ![Demo Version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65474235-623e-4044-a8d2-da66932feddd) | ![Full Version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3222737-0fdb-49ff-b635-bf2be862010e) |

During the development process, I faced challenges, particularly with adding `MainActivity.kt` and `activity_main.xml` for each directory. To overcome these, I made several modifications and incorporated insights from other sources.

**Note:** The main branch contains the initial project setup, while other branches provide step-by-step configurations and enhancements.
